# Read a path exported by GIMP's Layers & Channels dialog
#

# A new command "Read Gimp Path" for the Script menu that reads a path
# from a file created with "Export Path" in Gimp's Layers & Channels
# dialog and insert it into the document at a fixed position.
#
# The path is inserted at a fixed position so that if you import several
# paths from the same image these paths have the correct relative
# position.
#
# This you might want to change are the position at which the path is
# inserted, or scaling it, or placing it interactively.

"""Demo Script for GNU/LinuxTag and EuroPython 2002.

Repeat foot-prints along a path.

Usage: Select two objects, one to be used as the left foot-print and
another one as the path to place the footprints on. Make sure that the
path is in front of the foot print.

The script will place copies of the foot print along the path as if
someone had walked along the path.

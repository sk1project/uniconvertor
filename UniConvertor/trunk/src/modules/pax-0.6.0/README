Pax, version 0.6.0
==================


What is Pax?
------------

Pax is a Python module that allows direct access to Xlib functions and
data structures. In addition it defines a new Tk-widget class that can
be used to implement widgets in Python.


It is based on the X-extension. The Tk specific part is completely new.



Installation:
-------------

Currently this is only used by sketch and I have not tried to used for
anything else. See Sketch's README for instructions.




License:
--------

See the files COPYING and COPYING.xext

The file paxtkinter is a slightly modified copy of _tkinter.c from
Python 1.5.2 to work around problems with thread support. It has its own
license notice.

Similarly, the file intl.c, comes with its own copyright notice and
license.

## DETAILS

If you wish testing UniConvertor 2.0 you have two installation ways. 
First option is a distutils install with commands:
```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

But this way is not recommended. The most preferred option is a package 
installation (deb or rpm). You can create package using command:
```
python setup.py bdist_deb (for Ubuntu|Mint|Debian etc.)
python setup.py bdist_rpm (for Fedora|OpenSuse|Mageia etc.)
```
By installing the package you have full control over all the installed files 
and can easily remove them from the system (it's important for application
preview).

### Dependencies

Please note that application uses Python 2.x version. So Python interpreter
and python based dependencies should be for 2.x, but not 3.x

For successful build either distutils or deb|rpm package you need installing
some development packages. We describe dev-packages for Ubuntu|Debian, but for
other distros they have similar names. So, you need:
```
git
libcairo2-dev
liblcms2-dev
libmagickwand-dev
libpango1.0-dev
python-dev
python-cairo-dev
```

To run application you need installing also:
```
python-pil 
python-reportlab
python-cairo
```


### Running unittests

For developers or packagers, there are unittests. To run the unittest,
proceed as follows:

```
pip install pytest
pip install .
cd unittests
pytest
```
